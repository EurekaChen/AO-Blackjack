<ol>
	<li>AO Classic Blackjack play with one of 52-card decks.</li>
	<li>
		Aces may be counted as 1 or 11 points, 2 to 9 according to pip value, and tens and face cards
		count as ten points.
	</li>
	<li>
		The value of a hand is the sum of the point values of the individual cards. Except, a
		"blackjack" is the highest hand, consisting of an ace and any 10-point card, and it outranks all
		other 21-point hands.
	</li>
	<li>
		After the players have bet, the dealer will give two cards to each player and two cards to
		himself. One of the dealer cards is dealt face up. The facedown card is called the "hole card."
	</li>
	<li>
		If the dealer has an ace showing, he will offer a side bet called "insurance." This side wager
		pays 2 to 1 if the dealer's hole card is any 10-point card. Insurance wagers are optional and
		may not exceed half the original wager.
	</li>
	<li>
		Play begins with the player to the dealer's left. The following are the choices available to the
		player:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Stand</strong>: Player stands pat with his cards.</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Hit</strong>: Player draws another card (and more if he wishes). If this card causes
				the player's total points to exceed 21 (known as "breaking" or "busting") then he loses.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Double</strong>: Player doubles his bet and gets one, and only one, more card.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Split</strong>: If the player has a pair, or any two 10-point cards, then he may
				double his bet and separate his cards into two individual hands. The dealer will
				automatically give each card a second card. Then, the player may hit, stand, or double
				normally. However, when splitting aces, each ace gets only one card. doubling after
				splitting is allowed. If the player gets a ten and ace after splitting, then it counts as 21
				points, not a blackjack.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		After player has had his turn, the dealer will turn over his hole card. If the dealer has 16 or
		less, then he will draw another card.
	</li>
	<li>If the dealer goes over 21 points, then any player who didn't already bust will win.</li>
	<li>
		If the dealer does not bust, then the higher point total between the player and dealer will win.
	</li>
